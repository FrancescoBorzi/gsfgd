The high expression of miR-21 in the brain was also associated with high expression of EGFR in all irradiated mice examined; thus our data strongly support that EGFR and miR-21 are in a positive regulatory loop, because it is known that radiation stimulates miR-21 through the EGFR/Stat3 pathway and miR-21 activates the EGFR pathway.\'','22034847'),
