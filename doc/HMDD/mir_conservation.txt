Human miRNA conservation data, which was calculated based on miRNA family data of miRBase Release 18 using the method presented
by Wang et al. (Wang et al., Human microRNA oncogenes and tumor suppressors show significantly different biological patterns: from functions to targets. PLoS ONE 2010 5(9):e13067. )

For this method, Human miRNAs are divided into five categories according to their conservation, namely, an miRNA is conserved only in humans (5), primates (4), mammals (3), vertebrates (2), or other more distant species (1, which is the most conserved group).
