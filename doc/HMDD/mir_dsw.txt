This file contains the disease spectrum width (DSW) data of miRNA.
miRNA DSW was defined by Qiu et al. (Qiu et al. Scientific Reports 2012 in press).
For one miRNA, i, 
DSW(i)=n(i)/N
where, n(i) is the number of diseases associated with miRNA i, N is the total number of diseases that have reported associated miRNAs.
DSW of a miRNA represents its role in human disease.

DSW in this file was calculated based on miRNA-disease data in HMDD (version March-15, 2012). We calculated DSW at the miRNA-gene level and at the merged-miRNA-gene (i.e. let-7a-1 and let-7a-2 are merged to let-7a) level, respectively.
